              In the year 2009, we saw the introduction of the first ever
              decentralized payment network, the mother of all coins, Bitcoin
              <b>[1]</b>. In the years that followed, global interest grew and
              Bitcoin inspired the genesis of numerous cryptography based
              projects that also worked towards trustless secure payment
              systems and storage of value.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>
              Bitcoin uses blockchain technology where a distributed ledger
              records transactions chronologically and publicly. Subsequent
              advancement in the space gave rise to second
              generation projects like Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, Stellar,
              Monero and many others, which built on this concept by adding
              new features, and sometimes by acting as platforms for dApps -
              the execution of decentralised applications. Then finally in
              2015, Sergio Lerner published a paper describing the
              applicability of so-called Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) to the
              field of cryptography <b>[2]</b>. This concept was adopted by
              multiple third generation cryptocurrencies. One such project
              originally developed by Colin LeMahieu emerged by specifically
              targeting the scalability issues plaguing generations one and
              two: Raiblocks. Raiblocks rebranded to NANO in January 2018
              <b>[3]</b>.

              BANANO started as a joke between a devoted group of NANO
              contributors and resulted in a coin being the product of a
              considerable amount of effort (without taking itself too
              seriously). While it's true that BANANO kept big portions of the
              original node code to keep cross-chain compatibility between
              existing code libraries, many parameters have been fine-tuned,
              such as work requirements and units. As it progresses, the node
              code will likely diverge further. NANO has the mantra of
              <b>‘do one thing and do it well’</b>. BANANO, however, is more
              open to feature additions, e.g. on-chain messaging or privacy.
              BANANO doesn’t aim for drastic modifications of the reference
              implementation of the node at this early stage: it’s more about
              improving the ecosystem and ensuring we have the best developers
              to do so!
            </p>

              It’s hard to overlook the exceptional tools and utilities that
              our hard working <strike>developers</strike> monkeys have contributed thus far.
              Take a peek at BANANO’s mobile wallet, Kalium (<b>Figure 2</b>).
              It’s a modern mobile wallet designed to be efficient and
              effective when transferring BANANO between you and your banfam -
              that is to say, your BANANO Family. With it, you can send
              instant transactions to anyone, anywhere, for free! On top of
              this and in line with the overall philosophy behind BANANO,
              Kalium is easy-to-use to ensure anyone will be able to get
              started with BANANO in minutes, without requiring any
              crypto-related knowledge whatsoever.

              We also haven’t forgotten the roots of our BANANO tree. We made the tech from Kalium Wallet available for NANO users with

              BANANO prides itself in its active development and pro-active
              community. BANANO community members have created fascinating
              projects, such as an implementation of BANANO into Minecraft,
              guild rewards in mobile games and apps, and even faucet bots on
              popular streaming platforms and highly used tipbots on major
              social media platforms such as Telegram, Twitter, Discord and
              Reddit.

          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>
              One of the most impactful differences between NANO and BANANO is
              that we started with billions of newly minted coins (<b>Figure 3</b>), 3.4 billion to be exact, that we
              use to continually run
              faucets that propagate DAG technology, fuel the tipping economy,
              and fund community projects. In that way, our objectives are
              similar to those of the NanoCenter—a community of NANO fans,
              investors, and contributors who operate parallel to NANO core.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>
              BANANO follows a gamification approach and strives to also get
              into the hands of people who have never interacted with crypto
              before. Given its (apparently) silly and potassium-rich nature,
              BANANO is friendly and somewhat forgiving to new users. Let’s be
              real, losing “some memecoins earned from sh*tposting” is not
              half as bad as “suffering a stolen” on a large investment. After
              all, making the start with cryptocurrency as easy as possible
              through a fun attitude, gamification, and education is a main
              aim of the project, finally enabling everyone to finally handle
              crypto assets in general in a responsible way.

              sh*tposting, the BANANO operation has a <strike>highly skilled team</strike> dedicated
              community, and it is very, very, legit.

              In order to keep your precious BANANO safe, you'll need a
              wallet. A wallet can be accessed using a public key, also known
              as a wallet address; and a private key, also known as a seed.
              Together, the public key and the private key form a key-pair.
              The wallet address is its public key, it’s basically like your
              bank account number. You can share your wallet address with
              anyone in the world and your BANANO will remain secure. Every
              BANANO wallet address begins with the prefix, "ban_" (<b>Figure 4</b>).

              BANANO uses a Block Lettuce (<b>Figure 6</b>) architecture to
              achieve lightening-quick transfer speeds. Each account has its
              own blockchain. Transferring funds from one account to another
              requires two transactions: a send which deducts value from the
              sender's balance and a receive adds the same amount to the
              receiver's balance. An account encodes its accumulated total
              balance when it makes a transaction, therefore nodes only need
              to keep track of the latest block rather than expend larger
              resources to track an account's full transaction history.
              Correctness is maintained, however there is a vast reduction in
              time and work versus a single-blockchain architecture used by
              other cryptocurrencies.

              The BANANO ledger is secured through Open Representative Voting
              (previously called ‘delegated Proof-of-Stake’), a powerful
              decentralization mechanism that has no strong analog in
              Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (POS) algorithms. In
              conventional PoS systems, the account owner's node must be
              running to participate in voting. By contrast, BANANO account
              holders choose a representative node to vote on their behalf in
              the event of conflicting transactions. Continuously running a
              node is impractical for many everyday users; giving a
              representative the power to proxy vote reduces that requirement.
              A user has the ability to easily reassign their representative
              to any account at any time through a change transaction. The
              weight of the account is subtracted from the old representative
              and added to the new representative. No funds are moved in this
              transaction, and the representative does not have spending power
              of the account's funds.

          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-start">
            <p>
              PoW in BANANO is solely used as an anti-spam tool and
              computation is almost instant. Once a transaction is sent, the
              PoW for the next block can be pre-computed, as the previous
              block field is already known. Therefore, as long as the time
              between transactions is greater than the time required to
              compute the PoW, transactions appear instantaneous to users (<b>Figure 7</b>).

              NANO's Proof-of-Work mechanism intends to serve as an anti-spam
              mechanism at the cost of unnecessarily delaying block generation
              on low-end machines. This makes community projects and field
              studies harder to maintain and grow. NANO's ability to pre-cache
              one work upfront doesn't help much, and concurrent work caching
              often isn't feasible either. That's why for BANANO, we chose a
              quicker proof-of-work generation time, but kept the original
              algorithm (hashing a nonce that is concatenated with the block
              hash, until the result exceeds a certain threshold). As a
              result, the BANANO protocol runs on low power hardware, enabling
              it to be a lightweight, practical and decentralized
              cryptocurrency for everyday use. On average, generation times
              are 8x faster for BANANO than for NANO while consuming 8x less
              electricity. There's a mathematical formula to calculate this:
              (2⁶4 - 0xfffffe0000000000) / (2⁶4 - 0xffffffc000000000), this
              work generation is even mobile friendly! Existing work generator
              software is backwards compatible, but it should be adjusted to
              the new threshold to not waste energy unnecessarily.

              MonKeys solve this long-standing problem through the creation of

              Each MonKey has a unique combination of fur and eye colour, and
              can have additional accessories in varying styles, such as hats,
              glasses, shirts, pants, mouth types, tail decorations, and more!
              The value of the accessories is classified into 3 categories:
              basic, rare, and premium. The rarity ranges from 1/2 to 1/32 and
              1/1024 MonKeys, respectively. There are hundreds of billions of
              possible MonKey combinations. Consider that RGB color ranges
              from (0,0,0) to (255,255,255). Therefore, there are 256³ =
              16,777,216 color options. By only examining fur color and eye
              color generation we get 16,777,216² = 281,474,976,710,656 MonKey
              options. This is without even considering the 7 classes of
              accessories and their corresponding coloring! For testing
              purposes, we’ve implemented a MonKey generator right below (<b>Figure 9</b>). This generator allows you to
              experiment with MonKeys even
              without having a real wallet address (even though creating one
              is recommended and only takes seconds). You are welcome to try

              A well known cryptographic challenge is that of privacy: prevention of unauthorized extraction of
              information from communications over an insecure channel. Neither companies nor individuals want all of
              their information being publicly visible on a blockchain, in a way it can be read without any restrictions
              by governments, family members, friends, or business competitors. Serving as BANANO's privacy layer, CAMO
              (<b>Figure 10</b>)
              at its current stage is a way for two people to share a seed. To share it securely they put it in the
              blockchain, that's essentially it!

          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>
              Of note, CAMO BANANO Phase 1 as described here and currently being available allows for confidential
              transactions, but not for real privacy yet. Ongoing development will include the requirement of adding a
              new block type to the BANANO protocol and subsequently allow for sum-of-squares private transactions.

              Each BANANO wallet houses multiple addresses and is accessed using a seed. It is assumed that both party A
              (Alice) and B (Bob) in the transaction have an existing seed for an existing wallet. The main purpose of
              this system is to send funds from Alice's wallet to one of the wallets owned by Bob, knowing only Bobs
              seed and its first enclosed wallet. By splitting transactions of funds between multiple wallets under a
              single seed each party is in control of the funds but do not show up on a rich list.

              must
              agree on a third neutral location to use to mix the funds and obfuscate records of their transactions to
              any eavesdropper (Eve).<br><b>4-</b> Alice sends three transactions to herself to store the seed of a
              third party on the blockchain. To do this, she leverages the fact the BANANO balance field has a precision
              of 29 places after the decimal point, i.e. you can store 11 bytes of data in the balance field 2. Alice
              splits the 32 byte public key into three chunks of 11, 11, and 10 bytes and sends three transactions to
              herself encoding these bytes in the balance field.<br><b>5-</b> Bob looks through Alice's transactions
              history and finds three where the representative is the hash of the shared secret. Bob combines theses to
              obtain the seed Alice hid in the blockchain. This seed is now neutral to both participating parties, and
              <b>only</b> both parties have access to it. At this point, if Alice sends funds to this neutral location
              the transaction can be considered reversible.<br><b>6-</b> Alice sends funds to the first N addresses
              contained in the neutral seed, starting at the zeroth address. She uses multiple transactions where the
              total number N is determined by the total amount of funds to be sent. In the Camo Phase 1 release this is
              orders of 10 BANANO: 10, 100, 1000 .... In production it is intended to be split according to how
              transactions in the blockchain look at that point in time.
              <br><b>7-</b> Bob moves funds from each used address in the neutral seed to N separate addresses under a
              seed in his control. To Eve, it appears Alice simply sent out many random low payments, which then each
              went onto a second address. However, if Bob consolidated into his wallet at only its zeroth address, Eve
              could then collapse the graph and see all the transactions went from Alice to Bob.

              Using the same method as reversible transactions, a new wallet is created instead of a new seed. The new
              wallet is controlled by only one party, so transactions are not reversible. The new wallet is stored on
              the blockchain in almost the same way as the reversible seed. The only difference is that the
              representative is set to the hash of the hashed shared secret and the public key, to distinguish it from
              the reversible transaction.

              BANANO is freely distributed through faucets, games, contests, giveaways, and airdrops. To date, both NANO
              and Doge holders have been rejuvenated with yellow goodness via airdrops (more coming in the future).
              Apart from that, BANANO had a very unique distinction from basically all other cryptocurrency projects
              from the very beginning: <b>Free coin distribution through innovative faucet games</b>. You heard it
              right, we
              don’t have just some boring faucets, we have faucet games! The legendary <b>BANANO Runner</b> game
              (<b>Figure 11</b>)
              with its first round in April 2018 was a huge success and an unprecedented form of airdropping a new
              cryptocurrency to its community.

              One of the highest aims of the ongoing free distribution of BANANO always was (and still is) to keep the
              distribution fair. Unfortunately, there have been attempts to bot and exploit BANANO faucet games from the
              very beginning. That’s one of the reasons why BANANO Runner sadly had to be discontinued after 5 highly
              successful rounds with thousands of participants.

              It’s rarely mentioned that some fresh cryptocurrencies like BANANO (and it’s father NANO) do not require
              mining and therefore are highly innovative examples for ecologically “green” cryptocurrencies. However, in
              this case we purposefully branded our new <a class="text-secondary"

              MonkeyTalks is a proof-of-concept application showing how versatile BANANO can be, and how easy it can be
              used in new contexts. MonkeyTalks is a combination of a <b>self-sustaining BANANO faucet</b> and an
              <b>on-chain
                messaging platform</b> (<b>Figure 18</b>).
              First it’s a faucet because for sending a message you’ll need to pay a small fee in BANANO. Second, it’s
              self-sustaining since your payment in turn refills the faucet. And finally, it's on-chain because any
              message sent through MonkeyTalks it’s engraved into the transaction’s RAW: this means that all of the
              messages are publicly visible and basically immutable because they were written into the BANANO
              blockchain.
              MonkeyTalks is basically a proof-of-concept website that combines a faucet giving out free BANANO with an
              actual application BANANO can be used for. There’s a clear incentive to visit the site to claim the
              faucet, which in turn incentivizes users to pay BANANO for a message many people will see. To make this
              more interesting, you can also choose to pay a little more to highlight your message in a different
              color.<br>Visit

              While its ongoing free and fair distribution program surely resembles one of the biggest strengths of
              BANANO and has led to a rapidly growing community, it also logically leads to inflation. That’s why the
              BANANO team in July 2019 announced a monthly ‘Buy-Back and Burn’ scheme (<a class="text-secondary"
                href="https://medium.com/banano/banano-is-becoming-deflationary-3215ba3b41f5"
                target="_blank"><b>article</b></a>). In brief, the
              BANANO
              team uses earnings from faucet monetization (mainly mined coins and income from advertisements) to buy
              back BANANO from exchanges and subsequently sends all bought BANANO to a burn address, making respective
              coins ultimately inaccessible. The overall aim of this approach is to stabilize markets especially during
              the ongoing free distribution phase (<b>Figure 19</b>). Coin burns unrelated to this program have
              occurred, and
              may happen again in the future.

              • BANANO (BAN) is a fourth-generation cryptocurrency that offers feeless, instant and ecologically green
              transactions. It utilizes a novel DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based block-lettuce™ architecture, where
              each user possesses his own blockchain.

              • BANANO was forked in April 2018 from NANO. BANANO did no ICO whatsoever, instead all coins were and are
              distributed through an ongoing free and fair distribution program, through Airdrops, Faucet Games and
              other events. Meanwhile, BANANO is also experimenting with feature additions such as a privacy layer
              (<a class="text-secondary"
                href="https://medium.com/banano/introducing-camo-banano-bananos-privacy-layer-98a5bb0ecdb1"
                target="_blank"><b>Camo
                  BANANO</b></a>), on-chain messaging (<a class="text-secondary" href="https://monkeytalks.cc/"
                target="_blank"><b>MonkeyTalks</b></a>) and more.

          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>
              • In the context of distribution, one major aim of BANANO is using their infrastructure with easy-to-use
              mobile wallets (<a class="text-secondary" href="https://kalium.banano.cc/"
                target="_blank"><b>Kalium</b></a>) and Tipbots on several major social media platforms to onboard
              normies and
              crypto-noobs who have no idea yet what a cryptocurrency is. Of note, the key here is to make the start
              with crypto as easy as possible, and use a fun attitude and a gamification approach to get new users
              started without all the usual hassle, and then educate them to handle cryptocurrencies in a responsible
              way.

          <div class="col-12 d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p>
              • At the time of writing, BANANO is already heavily used in tens of thousands of daily on-chain
              transactions
              for tipping and payment within our community and on several third-party platforms.
